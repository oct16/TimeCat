### TimeCat -- A Magical Web Recorder

If you like playing games,  Warcraft 3 must be on that list. You may be curious about the video files exported by the game-why the video is only a few hundred KB even after you have played the game for an hour?  Soon you will realize what have a happened-the map inside the game has to be reloaded almost every time when you import the replay video. If you skip the step, the video won‚Äôt be played

 Actually the data recorded in the video is not a video file, but a series of actions come up with time stamps. When importing the map, you actually initialize a state. In this state, once the previous actions are restored,  you can restore the whole previous game process. This is what we called the basic principle of reply

For a video, it greatly reduces the size, assuming that we need to record an hour of 1080p24f video, in the case of uncompressed video   
```
Frames = 3600s * 24 = 86400frame

Supposing that each logical pixel is represented by three primary colors of RGB, 
each primary color is 8 bits (256 colors)
Frame size = (1920 * 1080) pixels * 8bits * 3 = 49766400bits

Converted to KB is 49766400bits / 8/1024 = 6075KB

Total video volume = 6075KB * 86400 = 524880000KB ‚âà 500GB
```

So compared with the traditional video recorder, assuming that the recording is 500KB, then the volume is reduced by about 524880000KB / 500KB ‚âà 1000000 times  in theory

In fact, the Web recorder also draws on such an idea, which is generally called Operations Log. In essence, it's recording a series of browser event data, re-render using the browser engine, and restore the previous operations. 

From a practical perspective, even if you compare the compressed video with an H.265 compression ratio of several hundred times, you can save at least 200 times in volume

Compared with traditional video streaming, its advantages obviously stand out:

1. Greatly reduce the size of video files
2. Very low consumption of CPU and memory
3. Lossless display, infinite zoom, window adaptation, etc.
4. Very flexible time jump, almost imperceptible buffer time
5. All information is live (text and pictures can be copied, links can be clicked, and the mouse can scroll)
6. You can easily record the sound, and synchronize the sound with the picture, and also translate the sound into subtitles similar to YouTube
7. It is convenient to modify the details of the video, such as desensitizing the displayed content, generating a heat map, etc.
8. The recorded serialized data is very useful for  the data analysis
¬†¬†¬†...

So the question is coming: Why do we have to record web pages? What are the scenarios?

I have though about the following aspects

1. The anomaly monitoring system, such as [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/), it can be understood that he is a tool that integrates Sentry and Web Recorder, which can playback the graphical interface and data logs of webpage errors to help Debug
2. Recording the user's behavior for analysis, such as [MouseFlow](https://mouseflow.com/). [LiveSession](https://livesession.io/), "connect" to the user's to see what people do through live streaming
3. Monitoring for customer service personnel, for example, Alibaba has 100,000 customer service personnel scattered throughout the country, and they need to record 7x24 hours of their service process. The performance requirements for monitoring on this order of magnitude are very High, Ali's internal tool is called `XReplay`
4. Collaborative tools, web live broadcast, etc., will also involve similar technologies
5. RPA

### Technical details of the [TimeCat](https://github.com/oct16/timecat)

![Architecture](./assets/architecture.png)

#### Take a snapshot of the DOM

The node data of the page can be easily obtained through the DOM API, but for our needs, it is obvious that the data provided by the DOM Node is too redundant. This step is to simplify the information by referring to the design of VirtualDom

```ts
interface VNode {
    type: number
    id: number
    tag: string
    attrs: Attrs
    children: VNode[]
    extra: Extra
}
```

After deep traversal of the DOM, the DOM is mapped to a VNode type node. The Nodes to be recorded are mainly three types `ELEMENT_NODE`, `COMMENT_NODE` and `TEXT_NODE`. After deserialized, it can be restored the state 

there are some nodes and attributes that need special treatment, such as

- `Input` and other types of` value` `checked` cannot be obtained from the DOM, and need to be obtained from the node
- The content of the `script` tag will not be executed later, so it can be directly skipped or marked as` noscript`
- `SVG` can be obtained directly, but it and it's children needs to use` createElementNS ("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", tagName) `to create

- If the `src` or` href` attributes are relative paths, they need to be converted to absolute paths
  ......

#### Record Actions that affect page element changes

DOM changes can use `MutationObserver`, listen to` attributes`, `characterData`,` childList` three types of changes
```ts
const observer = new MutationObserver((mutationRecords, observer) => {
    // Record the data
})
observer.observe(target, options)
```

With the help of the ability combination of `WindowEventHandlers` `addEventListener`, etc., you can monitor a series of operation events on the page

- Add Node Action
- Delete Node Action
- Change Attribute Action
- Scroll Action
- Change Location Action
...

Record mouse actions through `mouseMove` and` click` events

For the `MouseMove` event, it will be triggered frequently during the movement, resulting in much redundant data. Such data will waste a lot of space, so for the mouse tracking, we only collect a small number of key points, the simplest method is to use throttling to reduce the amount of data generated by the event, some disadvantages will come up:

  - Critical mouse coordinate data may be lost in the intercepted
  - huge data will be generated even if the movement distance is long. The better way is to calculate the movement trajectory through the `Spline Curves`. 

We can watches the input via `input` `blur` `focus` event of` Node.addEventListener`, but this can only listen to the user's behavior. If we assign values ‚Äã via JavaScript, we can't listen to the data Changes, at this time we can hijack some special properties through `Object.defineProperty`, without affecting the target, forward the new value to the custom handle, and handle the change in a unified method

```ts
const elementList: [HTMLElement, string][] = [
        [HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'value'],
        [HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'checked'],
        [HTMLSelectElement.prototype, 'value'],
        [HTMLTextAreaElement.prototype, 'value']
    ]

    elementList.forEach(item => {
        const [target, key] = item
        const original = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(target, key)
        Object.defineProperty(target, key, {
            set: function(value: string | boolean) {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    handleEvent.call(this, key, value)
                })
                if (original && original.set) {
                    original.set.call(this, value)
                }
            }
        })
    })
```

#### Optimization of MutationObserver

Because the DOM Diff Patch is implemented with the MutationObserver, it is necessary to collect and process the changed records, which involves some key issues: For instance, the timing of DOM changes is sequential, and Mutation can only be summarized as adding and deleting, However when calling insertBefore or appendChild, it will cause movement. These nodes must be processed and marked as moved, otherwise, the loss of node references may cause rendering errors.

#### Compatibility of MutationObserver

[Can I Use MutationObserver](https://caniuse.com/#search=mutationObserver) shows that only in IE11 and later, Android 4.4 and later can be used, compatible with the old browser can be through [MutationObserver-shim](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mutationobserver-shim) to support, but using shim may cause some fatal bugs of the collected data. there is also a situation that some websites may block the MutationObserver API, we can restore the `Native Code` by creating an Iframe

#### Canvas, Iframe, Video and other elements

- Canvas: Use monkey patching to extending or modifying the original AP to get the corresponding action
- Iframe: In the non-cross-domain state, you can also directly access the internal nodes to record, similar to Shadow DOM etc
- Video: By Detect the HTMLVideoElement to get and record video status
- Flash: Record by screen capture

#### External links

After loading HTML, it will refer to many external resources, usually in many forms

For ExampleÔºö
- Absolute path  ``<img src="/xx.png" />`` 
- Relative path ``<img src="./xx.png" />`` 
- relative to the current path ``<img src="xx.png" />`` 
- The Protocol-relative URL``<img src="//cnd.xx.png" />``
- [Responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) ``src="www.xxx.png" srcset="www.xxx.png 1x, www.xxx.png 2x"``   
...

The above requires a converter to deal with the path problem. In the ``Deserialize`` stage, they can be converted to the absolute path under the original domain in order to load normally in cross-domain
There is also a situation where the problem of loading resources for third-party resources requires the proxy server.

###### CORS Error

Usually, due to the limitation of the resources of the recorded website with the CORS Policy. The solution is that you can add a white list or ignore it if the resources are controllable. The other is to use a proxy server.
> Reference article: [3 Ways to Fix the CORS Error](https://medium.com/@dtkatz/3-ways-to-fix-the-cors-error-and-how-access-control-allow-origin-works-d97d55946d9)


#### Rendering time of SPA web page

Before starting to play, we need to restore the previous data to the real DOM. This will take a certain time and you will see a white page, which depends on your browser performance and recording web page resources. Refer to `FMP (First Meaningful Paint)`, during the loading process, the skeleton map can be dynamically generated from the previously mapped data, and wait for the FMP to send the Ready signal before playing

> Reference article: [Time to First Meaningful Paint](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BR94tJdZLsin5poeet0XoTW60M0SjvOJQttKT-JK8HI/view#)

#### Simulate mouse path through splines

When the user moves the mouse on the page, many `mouseMove` events will be generated. The coordinates and timestamp of the track are obtained through` const { x, y } = event.target`

If I use a mouse to trace a track on the page, I may get the coordinate points like the picture below
<img src="./assets/heart1.png" width="300">

However, on most occasions we do not require 100% restoration of accurate mouse path for the scenario of recording, and we only care about two situations:

    1. Where does the mouse click?
    2. Where does the mouse stay?

After simplifying the mouse path through these two strategies, it takes only about 6 points to draw a üíñ, to simulate the virtual path of the mouse through the spline curve

<img src="./assets/heart2.png" width="300">

After filtering out the key points through the rules, the B-spline curve calculation function is used, When redrawing the mouse position during rendering, you can get a mouse with an approximate curve Track

#### Optimize the data by Diff string

When we constantly taping the content in an input box, our Watcher function will continuously respond to events, through `Event.target.value` you can get the latest value of the current `HTMLInputElement`, you can use the throttling function to filter Some redundant responses are dropped, but it is not enough. For example, the text in a TextArea will be very long and long. Assuming the length of the text is n, we add 10 characters after the text, then the response The length is:
> 10n + ‚àë(k=1, n=10)

Visible will produce a lot of data

After passing by Diff Patch, modifying the string `abcd` to `bcde` can be expressed as:

> <h3><del>a</del>bcd<ins>e</ins></h3>

```ts
const patches = [
    { type: 'delete', index: 0, count: 1 },
    { type: 'add', index: 3, value: 'e' }
]
```

#### Generate heat map from mouse data

Recorded a coordinate info through a mouse event, the heat map can be easily generated for analyzing the user's behavior data by [heatmap.js](https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/).

When the page switches, we need to reset the heat map. If it is a single-page application, we can monitor changes on the page via  `popstate` and  `hashchange` in the `History`

![heatmap](./assets/heatmap.png)

#### Desensitization to user privacy

We can obtain and process some personal privacy data through the annotation of the DOM during development `Node.COMMENT_NODE` likeÔºö `<!-- ... -->`Ôºâannotation. Based on  agreed statements, we only have to process the requirements of the DOM tag that needs to be desensitized. For example, if want hide tag`<button>`, we need change it into`<!--hidden--><button><button>`

#### Sandboxing improves safety

The recorded content may be provided by a third party, which means that there may be certain risks. for example: `<div onload="alert('something'); script..."></div>`, or some events in our player may also affect the playback content, so we need a sandbox to isolate the playback environment, `Iframe Sandbox` provided by HTML5 remains a good choice, which can help us easily isolate the environment such as:

- Script cannot be executed
- Cannot send ajax request
- Cannot use local storage, ie localStorage, cookies, etc.
- Cannot create alert and windows, such as window.open or target = "_ blank"
- Cannot send form
- Cannot load additional plugins such as flash etc.
- Cannot perform tricky for autoplay. For example: autofocused, autoplay

#### Play jump and fast forward

##### Play
The player will have a accurate timer. The action data is stored in a stack. Each data is a frame. With `RAF(RequestAnimationFrame)` to exec the next frame

##### Pause
pause timer through `cancelAnimationFrame`

##### Fast forward
double the speed of the acquisition rate

##### Jump
Jumping is a complicated problem. If you want to achieve a Bi-Directional jump that can be forward and backward like a video, due to the constraints of the rendering engine, I did not implement a reverse rendering method but solved it by a special method

To achieve a Bi-Directional jump, the idea here is to calculate the corresponding `S(Snapshot)` and `A (Action)` at a certain distance in memory

| _S_ | `A` | `A` | `A` | _S_ | `A` | `A` | _S_ | `A` | `A` | `A` | ...... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------ |

So `[SAAA]` formed a block, when the jump behavior occurs, it will be located in the corresponding block for calculation and rendering

#### Record audio and generate subtitles

Audio recording can be provided by the HTML5 WebRTC. Since it mainly records human voice, it doesn‚Äôt not need high standard in recording quality. I thus chose the 8000 sample rate, 8-bit rate and mono PCM recording format, later can be converted into lossy compressed `mp3` format to save space. Subtitles will be automatically generated after analyzing the recording files by some third-party services

#### Gzip on the client

Gzip generally compresses the transmitted data in the network application layer, but our data does not only exist in the database, there may be three storage type:

- The server stores TCP => DB
- Local storage LocalStorage, IndexedDB, Web SQL
- The data is persisted in the script and saved as a local file, such as directly exporting a working HTML file

Greatly reducing the data size before exporting or transmitting,

On the client side, the compression based on `Gzip`, As a result I chose [Pako](https://nodeca.github.io/pako/) to compress the data. As the core of Gzip is Deflate, and Deflate is based on LZ77 and Huffman tree. The text data is converted into `Uint8Array` through Gzip, and then `Uint8` is converted into the corresponding `ASCII`. The advantage to that is each encoding only use 1byte which reduce the volume by about 5 times by compression

#### Data upload

We can use indexedDB to store client data. IndexedDB has much larger storage room than LocalStorage with generally no less than 250MB or even no upper limit. ON top of that, it utilizes object store and is available to transaction. The important point is that it is asynchronous. That means it will not block the operation of the Web Recorder. The data can be uploaded to the server after that

#### Load SDK

The RollUp packer can generate multiple formats, such as `UMD` and `ESM`, etc. Loading SDK in the project or using the Chrome plug-in to inject the UMD module, we can easily load the code and control it to record the data.
